## What's inside?
- Razor Pages
Razor Pages is a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.
- WebApi
REST APIs with .NET and C#
ASP.NET makes it easy to build services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices.

With ASP.NET you use the same framework and patterns to build both web pages and services, side-by-side in the same project.
